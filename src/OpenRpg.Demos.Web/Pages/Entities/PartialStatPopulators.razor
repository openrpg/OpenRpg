   ## Stat Populators
   As you saw in the last chapter we have a decent understanding of stats and how they can be populated, but lets take a slightly 
   deeper dive into how to make stat populators and how you can layer multiple populators together to allow re-use and composition.
   
   The main job of a stat populator (or any variable populator) is to take in `Effect` and `Variables` then populate the stats
   that have been passed in.
   
   > For example if you have a `Damage` stat you will need to compute that value from all the related damage based effects applied,
   > this could come from your `Race`, `Class`, `Equipment` or any other source of effects you have on the entity with stats.
   
   To understand this more lets look deeper at the underlying code to understand what we need to do.

   ## `IStatsPopulator` Interface
   The `IStatsPopulator` interface actually just wraps the generic `Variable` populator interface, but at the heart of it 
   you need to implement the following:
   
   ```csharp
   void Populate(IStatsVariable stats, IReadOnlyCollection&lt;Effect&gt; activeEffects, IReadOnlyCollection&lt;IVariables&gt; relatedVars);
   ```
   
   You have free reign over how you do that, but basically you need to take the effects that are being provided which should cover *ALL* effects
   currently applied for processing, then any related vars (which may be null/empty). This could be as simple as:
   
   ```csharp
   public void Populate(IStatsVariable stats, IReadOnlyCollection&lt;Effect&gt; activeEffects, IReadOnlyCollection&lt;IVariables&gt; relatedVars)
   {
      var strengthValue = (int)activeEffects.CalculateBonusFor(FantasyEffectTypes.StrengthBonusAmount, FantasyEffectTypes.StrengthBonusPercentage);
      var dexterityValue = (int)activeEffects.CalculateBonusFor(FantasyEffectTypes.DexterityBonusAmount, FantasyEffectTypes.DexterityBonusPercentage);
      var constitutionValue = (int)activeEffects.CalculateBonusFor(FantasyEffectTypes.ConstitutionBonusAmount, FantasyEffectTypes.ConstitutionBonusPercentage);
      var intelligenceValue = (int)activeEffects.CalculateBonusFor(FantasyEffectTypes.IntelligenceBonusAmount, FantasyEffectTypes.IntelligenceBonusPercentage);
      var wisdomValue = (int)activeEffects.CalculateBonusFor(FantasyEffectTypes.WisdomBonusAmount, FantasyEffectTypes.WisdomBonusPercentage);
      var charismaValue = (int)activeEffects.CalculateBonusFor(FantasyEffectTypes.CharismaBonusAmount, FantasyEffectTypes.CharismaBonusPercentage);
      var allAttributeValue = (int)activeEffects.GetPotencyFor(FantasyEffectTypes.AllAttributeBonusAmount);

      stats.Strength(strengthValue + allAttributeValue);
      stats.Dexterity(dexterityValue + allAttributeValue);
      stats.Constitution(constitutionValue + allAttributeValue);
      stats.Intelligence(intelligenceValue + allAttributeValue);
      stats.Wisdom(wisdomValue + allAttributeValue);
      stats.Charisma(charismaValue + allAttributeValue);
   }
   ```
   
   This is actually an old example from the `OpenRpg.Genres.Fantasy` library but as you can see we take the effects we care about
   and then apply them to the related stats, and the best thing is you can configure this however you want.

  ## Partial/Composite Stat Population
  So far we have discussed how to populate all stats and that's great, but what if you want lots of little populators working
  together rather than one big one?
  
  Well dont worry we already have something for that, so we have the `IPartialStatPopulator` which has exactly the same
  implementations as the regular one, but it also contains a `Priority` field that lets you indicate in what order
  the partial populators should be run.
  
  This however is just part of the puzzle, as you can implement as many partial populators as you want but you still need
  some way to bring them together, and that's where `CompositeStatPopulator` comes in.
  
  ```csharp
  var statPopulator = new CompositeStatPopulator(new [] {
     new SomePartialPopulator(),
     new SomeOtherPartialPopulator()
     // others
  });
  ```
  
  As you can see you can just add as many as you want, or just inherit from it and internally load what you want internally,
  which is what the `OpenRpg.Genres.Fantasy` example ones do.
