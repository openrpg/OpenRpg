   ## Advanced Stats
   Now that we have covered the basics around computed stats based off effects its time to dive a bit deeper into this topic.
   
   As you have seen your stats can be seen as a culmination of all effects on you, and at the moment we have added effects at
   race and class level as well as providing manual effects on the character, but in the real world you may want to get 
   effects from equipment, buffs, multi classing etc.
   
   We also haven't discussed the notion of `state` vs `stats`, so for example your max health can be seen as static as 
   its computed once and possibly recomputed on effect changes etc, but your ACTUAL HEALTH value can change from various factors
   such as being hit, drinking a potion, being poisoned etc, so while `Health` is kind of like a stat it is dynamic in value
   and is stored separately as a `State`.

    ## Damage/Defense Stats
    In these examples we are sticking to `Pure Damage` and `Pure Defense` and using `Dark Damage` and `Dark Defense` as a stand in
    for magic damage. In the real world you may have multiple damage sources and you can define as many as you want.
    
    The `OpenRpg.Fantasy` library comes with the notion of the following melee damage types:
    - Damage (No affinity type damage)
    - Slashing
    - Piercing
    - Blunt
    - Unarmed
    
    And the following magical damage types:
    - Fire
    - Ice
    - Earth
    - Wind
    - Light
    - Dark
    
    As with all the stuff in these libraries you can use as much or as little of it as you want, but to keep things simple we will only
    be using pure damage/defense for melee and dark damage/defense for magic so we don't have to worry about juggling multiple types of 
    damage in the effects.

  ## Stats (static) vs State (dynamic)
  So like mentioned above MaxHealth is one of your `Stats` and Health can be seen as dynamic, and this becomes important when
  we think about how we want to save/load our characters and related data.
   
  We could simply just dump the whole character object into JSON or some other format and load it back in and call it a day,
  but this can cause you issues down the line. For example lets say you save your character on v1.0 of your game by dumping
  the character and all stats and associated items etc. Then an update comes along for v1.1 which adds a new +10 maxhp bonus to your race, you get 
  the update and boot up your game loading your save and you dont have this bonus maxhp as your character had its maxhp baked 
  into the save.
   
  To get around this we try to think about the differences between static vs dynamic data in persistence terms and you generally 
  want to cull all static data on persistence actions as it should all be regenerated when the character is loaded in, the only data 
  that REALLY needs persisting from the stats is dynamic data like Health and Magic and any other `State` variables you add.

   ## General Data Persistence
   So while we are discussing persistence its worth saying that in most cases you want to create an object which encapsulates
   the key aspects of a character. In the above example where we dumped everything its a massive waste as we are saving race,
   class, effect, stat data as well as potentially other guff in real world scenarios.
   
   So it is best to create a separate model which would contain the key bits we care about:
   
   ```csharp
   public class PersistedCharacter
   {
      public string NameLocaleId { get; set; }        // These may not ACTUALLY be locale ids if you let players name the character
      public string DescriptionLocaleId { get; set; }
      public int RaceId { get; set; }
      public int ClassLevels { get; set; }
      public int ClassId { get; set; }
      public int Health { get; set; }  
      public int Magic { get; set; }
      // Maybe custom effects if you do not generate them each time on char creation 
   }
   ```
   
   The main thing to look at above is that the Race, Class are stored as Ids so they can be used to lookup the race/class
   data when the save is loaded, this way your save files are lightweight and do not contain any data that can be regenerated.
   
   Also with this approach we solve the previous v1.0 -> v1.1 problem, as we would load up the `PersistedCharacter` then
   use those details to build back up the `AutoStatsCharacter` and we can regenerate the stats, which would give us our
   new improved MaxHp then we just manually overwrite the `character.Stats.Health(persistedCharacter.Health)` etc.
   
   > We will touch more on persistence in a later section as there are some existing models to help with this scenario
