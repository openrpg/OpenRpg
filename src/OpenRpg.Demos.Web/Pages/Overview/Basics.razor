  ## About These Demos/Docs
  
  These demos are all run inside the browser so its easier to demonstrate how to use all the main features without
  you needing to pick an engine or run a console app. It also makes it easier to just show the high level information
  without worrying about making complex UIs or game assets.
  
  For the most part this application is using:
  - Blazor (To allow us to use C# directly in browser)
  - Bulma (For styling things)
  
  This is all meant to be seen as a starting point and explanation so you can take what is discussed here and roll it out 
  into your own projects, be it Unity, Godot, Monogame etc.

  ## OpenRpg Composability
  Almost all parts of OpenRPG are built to be composable to build whatever sort of RPG system you require, so even if
  we show you a way to do something with out the box parts, you can often implement your own versions or recompose the
  objects however you wish.
  
  > For example you may have a fantasy based character system which has an inventory based on slots with turn based combat,
  or you may have an action scifi based game which has an infinite inventory or even a party based game etc.
  
  As its almost impossible to cater for all scenarios, we focus on providing the building blocks for you to be able to 
  compose however you wish for your scenario.
  
  > A lot of the demos here are building off the `Genres` library which acts as a unifying layer to build more specific
  > libraries off, so when you see things like `FantasyEffectTypes` thats the effect types that are available withing the
  > `OpenRpg.Genres.Fantasy` library. So keep that in mind when you see the demos and when you are building your own 
  > stuff as there is no point re-inventing the wheel if we have already done it for you.

  ## Managing Data
  You are free to manage your data however you want within this system, you can code things like races/classes/items in C#
  or you can save the data in json/xml/binary/whatever files and load them at runtime. For the most part in this demo we will
  be hardcoding everything in C# but you can manage your data however you wish. We provide a basic example editor within 
  the OpenRpg project which uses json but can easily be configured to use xml/binary/yaml/bson etc (built off LazyData lib).
  So if you are unsure how to best hadle your data have a look at how that one works and change it to do what you need.
  
  We do have the notion of repositories and locale data which can be expressed within the system but its up to you to populate them,
  in this example app there is some infrastructure done that provides simple examples, but in the real world you can satisfy these
  however you want.
