  ## Common Components
  
  While OpenRpg contains loads of bits related to Characters, Items, Combat etc it also contains a few common components
  which are used frequently all over the place, such as `Requirement`, `Effect`, `Modifier` as well as some interfaces
  like `IHasLocaleDescription`, `IHasDataId` etc.

  ## `Requirement` component
  This is one of the most common components and basically indicates something cannot be used without meeting the requirements.
  A good example of this would be an item that you can only equip if you are a `Fighter`. It can be applied to almost
  everything, so you can have effects with requirements, races with requirements, classes with requirements and many other
  objects.
  
  [See Source Here](https://github.com/openrpg/OpenRpg/blob/master/src/OpenRpg.Core/Requirements/Requirement.cs)
  
  It contains a `RequirementType` property which can be anything, a required race, class, item, quest or anything else. 
  There is also a `AssociatedId` which represents a linked Id if needed, such as if you had a quest requirement for you
  to have 2 loaves of bread, you would use the `AssociatedId` to be the item id of `Bread` and the `AssociatedValue` would
  be 2. You may not always have an `AssociatedId` AND an `AssociatedValue` depending on the requirement type, but its
  common to have at least one populated.
  
  Common examples of using this would be locking Race choices until trigger has been met (i.e game completed) or you 
  can only pick advanced classes once a basic class in that tree has been completed (i.e Fighter -> Gladiator -> Warlord).

  ## `IEffect` component
  Effects are almost as prevelant as `Requirement` components, but represents that something gives you an effect.
  
  It is primarily meant to act as a mechanism for you to dynamically populate/alter stats, such as an `Item` which gives you
  +5 to strength when equipped. However you can also make all stats dynamic by using effects on `Race` and `Class` components
  so you can compose all your characters stats from their race/class bonuses.
  
  Effects can also have `Requirements`, so you may have an item that has multiple effects but certain ones are locked to a
  given race, or for a level, quest, stat requirement etc.

    ## `Modification` components
    Modifications allow you to alter existing objects in a dynamic way, so a common example would be like how in games you can 
    enchant/gem items.
  
    The modification system is split into `ModificationAllowance` components which indicate that you can modify an object 
    (usually an item) and expresses the type of modification allowed as well as how many times it can be modified, and can
    optionally have requirements. An example would be if you wanted to have 2 gem slots but they were locked until you had
    reached item affinity level 10.
  
    [See ModificationAllowance here](https://github.com/openrpg/OpenRpg/blob/master/src/OpenRpg.Core/Modifications/ModificationAllowance.cs)
  
    The last part of modifications is `IModification` which expresses the type of modification and the effects it has,
    this may be a gem or an enchantment or even something else like a blacksmithing effect or a rune. It is up to you to
    define what modification types can be used, the system just uses ids to look up links etc.

    ## `IVariables&lt;T&gt;` components
    Variables act as an extensible place for custom variables to be stored on object, so for example on a character you may want to store
    their *str*, *dex*, *con* etc stats in a fantasy setting, but in a sci-fi setting or custom setting you may not need those so want another
    set of stats. However you look at it all genres would want the notion of *stats* its just what stats there are available that would be different.

    So we have this notion to allow a streamlined way to store your own custom data on objects without having to worry about interfaces. Another example
    would be that in some settings you may want your `ItemTemplate` objects to contain information on weight of the item if you have a weight based inventory,
    but as thats not always applicable we make it so you can apply whatever you want to a dictionary-like structure.

    The fantasy genre has a great example of this as it has helpers to add stats in a fairly seamless way, and you can add whatever you want to it in same sort of way.
    - [Stat Variable Keys](https://github.com/openrpg/OpenRpg.Fantasy/blob/master/src/OpenRpg.Genres.Fantasy/Types/StatsVariableTypes.cs)
    - [Stat Variable Helpers](https://github.com/openrpg/OpenRpg.Fantasy/blob/master/src/OpenRpg.Genres.Fantasy/Extensions/StatExtensions.cs)
    
    Currently loads of objects expose the notion of variables, such as templates, characters, loot tables, items etc.
